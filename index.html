        <p class="lead mb-4">My skills consist of public speaking, debate, communication, and intrapersonal among many others. Iâ€™ve developed these skills throughout my educational career by giving speeches at professional events and other programs on the topic of important issues plaguing the world. Iâ€™ve held various leadership positions in multiple high school clubs and college school orgs which helped me further strengthen these skills. Iâ€™ve held positions in organizations such as my high schoolâ€™s Associated Student Body, the Junior State of America, Diversify Our Narrative, and Lambda Sigma Gamma among others. Holding positions entails having the ability to carry out functions like pitching proposals, training junior staff, networking, and leading meetings which I have demonstrated and make me an effective leader.
<br><br>

 I am heavily involved in politics, and I do my best to stay informed through reliable media outlets and by being physically involved in campaigns. I am passionate about social issues due to the prevalent division in society, and because I want to ensure that as many people as possible have a voice and a chance at sharing their narratives. Additionally, I enjoy learning about how to help people that are part of marginalized groups by listening to Black, Indigenous and people of colorâ€™s(BIPOC) podcasts that pertain to their daily lives in America. I firmly believe it is imperative to advocate for marginalized groups through activism, education, legislative action, and peaceful protesting. Iâ€™ve attended multiple womenâ€™s marches, climate change marches, and black lives matter marches among many others. All in all, I demonstrate that I am a self-learner by actively seeking opportunities in which I can serve my community and advocate for causes I believe in. Because of my own hard work and passion for everything I do, it is evident that I am a self-made young activist and soon to be a success story.
<br><br>

While I am passionate about social issues on a broader spectrum, education reform is something Iâ€™ve been advocating for since high school. I served as Director of Outreach Chapter Development for the Junior State of America where I was responsible for reaching out to students in inner city schools. I came from an inner city school myself; therefore, I recognize the importance of introducing resources into low income communities--especially schools. During my time as Director of Outreach Development, I was able to to establish over 10 new chapters, seek scholarships for students who were interested in attending conventions, help students apply for summer programs at prestigious universities such as Stanford, Georgetown, and UCLA, and I was also able to help students apply for scholarships to these summer programs. Furthermore, I continued my involvement in education reform in college by joining a campaign called Diversify Our Narrative and also by becoming a mentor for the Alliance Charter Network--where I graduated from. I decided to get involved on a smaller scale so that I could personally directly see the change I was effecting on my community. All in all, my experience as a first-generation Latina navigating education in America is what sparked my passion to help others like me who seek to pursue higher education.
